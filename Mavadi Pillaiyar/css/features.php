      <ul class="text">
        <li>Cameras and Phones are not allowed within the temple.</li>
        <li>You need to remove your footwear and wash your feet at the tap outside before going in.</li>
        <li>While washing your feet, sprinkle a little water on your head as a symbol of cleansing and purification.</li>
        <li>Do not step on the wide step-like protuberance at the entrance of the temple; instead step over it. Itâ€™s a way of respecting your entrance into the temple.</li>
        <li>There are five main pooja rituals at set times. But you can also get tickets at the counter inside to get individual blessings for you and your family.</li>
